  title: Delphi Select
  version: '2.2.5.4'
  description: >
    Delphi Select is a restful web Application Programming Interface (API) that
    allows access to the Experian Consumer Bureau and associated products and
    services through directed consumer targeting. It sits behind the OKTA
    service which provides authentication by user, business unit  or reseller
    and allows access to the developer portal test environment, directly
    simulating the live production environment.

    A call to Delphi Select can be one of the following types:

    - <b>Creating a Consumer Application</b>
      Delphi Select is predominantly used to target an applicant (Single Application) or group of applicants (Joint Application) based on name, address and date of birth information. This information is passed to Delphi Select to allow it to perform an Experian Bureau Search. As part of the application process a number of different products can be requested to support multiple business flows; this is configurable using the input API. However, the availability of various products is subject to the system account settings. A client must have the required permissions to access each product.

    - <b>Reprocessing a Consumer Application</b>
      Allows for an existing application to be retargeted on the Experian Credit Bureau in cases where application details have been incorrectly entered or new information has been obtained. Any Reprocessed Applications will always retarget the Experian Credit Bureau and write an appropriate footprint (set by the client). Delphi Score processing will de-duplicate any Credit Search Footprints (CAPS), if they occur within a three-day period of each other. All Credit Search Footprints (CAPS) are recorded for audit purposes. A Reprocess should not be used for a stand-alone Affordability call.

    - <b>Performing a Second Phase Call</b>
      Allows for additional products to be requested as part of an application using only the Experian Unique Reference Number and the appropriate control input values. Predominantly used by businesses to gather additional product data at various stages of an application without having to re-enter the applicant(s) details. For example, the system owner may wish to perform an initial credit assessment and then want to Identity Authenticate those applicants that are credit accepts; Delphi Select provides this functionality, through a Consumer Application followed by a Second Phase call for Identity Authenticate via use of the Consumer Application Experian Unique Reference Number and the appropriate control input values.

    - <b>Performing a Quotation to Full</b>
      Delphi Select allows for input requests to be processed as quotations using a quotation search type on the input call. These quotation calls allow a lender to leave a soft footprint on the Experian Bureau. A Quote To Full call is required when the customer chooses to make an application or credit, based on the quotation / eligibility response. Converting the quotation application into a full application will place a hard footprint search type on the Experian Bureau.

    - <b>Retrieving a Previous Application</b>
      Allows for the retrieval of a previously submitted Consumer Application including the results of the individual products requested. This call type must contain the original Consumer Application Experian Application Reference as the unique identifier to allow Delphi Select to retrieve the relevant application.

    - <b>Receive Data</b>
      Once an input request has been received, Delphi Select will process the request for the required products and return an output API response that contains a Unique Experian Application Reference and the results of the search.

    - <b>Metrics</b>
      The API response will provide metrics on the transaction start time and end time. Please note that the values displayed are not representative of the values that will be returned in the live environment.
